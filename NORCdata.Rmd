# Introduction
  

<!-- The research question: is whether one favors capital punishment or not independent of race? -->


$H_0$: race and opinion on capital punishment are independent.  
$H_A$: opinion on capital opinion is related to race


<!--  Download the data from NORC -->
at https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data/spss download the zip file 2018.spss.zip

<!-- Upload the zip file; it comes in as a .sav file -->


```{r}
library(foreign)
# put data set name in the read
GPSS <- read.spss("dataset.sav", use.value.label=TRUE, to.data.frame=TRUE)
```


```{r}
GPSS$RACE
GPSS$CAPPUN
```

<!-- Both variables are categorical; load the appropriate helper file.  Notice that there are <NA> entries; remove these -->


# Descriptive Summary

## Graphical summary: 
  
Bar plot; use percent

## Numerical summary:


# Inferential

```{r}
table1 = xtabs(~CAPPUN + RACE, na.action = 'na.omit', drop.unused.levels=T, data=GPSS)
table1
```

<!-- use chisq test to determine whether RACE and CAPPUN are independent.   If there are dependent, use the function fisher.two to determing which levels are dependent -->

# Discussion/Conclusions
